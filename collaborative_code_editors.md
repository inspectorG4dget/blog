# Repl.it

[ReplIt][Replit] allows for collaborative code editing while also persisting the collaborative session, as well as affording the ability to run the actual code. However, this does require a login to access and there appears to be no guest access 

# CollabEdit

[CollabEdit][CollabEdit] is a collaborative <s>document</s> code editor with support for a wide variety of languages and a built-in chat feature

It differs from other platforms in that it is not behind a login wall and uses a randomly generated room code to persist the collaborative session (but I don't know for how long)
