[WhenIsGood][WhenIsGood] is a helpful, free tool used to schedule meeting times.

Since it is a web-based tool, it is cross-platform. But unlike most web-based tools, it does not require an account (even though having one makes it easier to track all events under that account).

It is both feature complete and has a good enough UI, which makes it usable for me.

## Features
### Meeting duration

### Highlight hours

### Multi-person availability
This marks who is unable to make a given time

### Schedulable time
