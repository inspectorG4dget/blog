# Introduction

I've somewhat always subscribed to the buy-once, buy-forever philosophy. I don't like to have to keep renewing my gear, so I don't mind something slightly more expensive if it'll last forever. But I'm also not one to spend too much money on things or compromise on my feature requirements. So here's a list of the gear I've purchased over the years that are worth the sticker-price.

# Home Automation

I use Google Home for my home automation in conjunction with my [phone][phone], [Google Home Mini][ghome mini], and [Amazon Echo Dot][echo dot]

## Smart Outlets

Smart outlets are an easy way to get into home automation. It's easy to plug in existing devices into smart outlets and control them with Google Home. Additionally, Google Home lets you pretend that an outlet is actually a light, if for example a lamp is what is connected to it.

## Smart Bulbs

Smart bulbs are the next step in home automation. Philips Hue bulbs are usually the top of the line and are appropriately expensive. I chose to buy the Teckin bulbs, which have the same features and were a bargain at $50 for 4 bulbs.

Features to expect of smart bulbs:

1. LED bulbs
2. Controllable through a smartphone app
   1. Sometimes, they also come with an independent controller
3. Integratable with Google Home
4. Brightness control
5. Color control

# Backpacks

Over the years, I've gone through many backpacks. Consequently, many backpacks have come to ruin my back. Being a programmer (and therefore on a chair, at a desk for long periods of time), the health of my back is very important to me. As a result, I've had to move away from high-capacity backpacks with low ergonomic support. Here's some of my backpacks worth mentioning, along with my criteria for what I look for in a backpack.

## Criteria

1. Capacity
2. Laptop hammock
   1. Bonus: TSA compliant Laptop compartment
3. Durability
4. Organization capability
5. Ergonomics - I want the weight of the backpack off my back/shoulders

## A Word about Osprey

I'm not one to endorse companies, but I would be remiss if I didn't spend a minute here. When I was looking for my next backpack, my first instinct was to go to [Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC)][mec] as their products are legendary for their durability. Through a happy accident, I was introduced to [Osprey][osprey] at a sporting goods store. They told me the following story, which is why I now buy Osprey gear almost exclusively:

> A boy (let's call him Cody) went scouting with his friends. One of his friends (let's call him Zach) put some food in his backpack and left it in the tent. One day when they return from a hike, they noticed that many bags had been ripped apart (including Cody's Osprey backpack), and the food was gone from Zach's backpack.
> 
> Zach's mom called the company that made his backpack, which advertised a lifetime warranty. She was told that the backpack was not warrantable since Zach should not have had food in it, in the tent.
> 
> Meanwhile, Cody's mom called Osprey and Osprey sent Cody a new backpack. But Osprey didn't stop there - they sent a new backpack for every kid in the troop.

Now, this is a pretty obvious PR stunt, but it's sure bought my loyalty for Osprey products, even at their youre-buying-into-the-warranty high cost.

## Osprey Kode 32

This is actually a ski/snowboard bag that I purchased before I got into winter sports. Despite not being a laptop bag, this is very versatile and can fit any role it is thrown into. Additionally, it also has multiple minimal organizers that can hold stationery, USB keys, etc to fit my purpose.  
Sorry Osprey, I haven't actually used this for winter sports, so I can't review it for that purpose. Here's someone else's review of this bag for its use in harsher winter conditions

The highlights for me are:

1. Internal volume/capacity
2. Durability of the material (I've been using this since 2014 to do everything from professional/technical carrying, to flight travel and camping)
3. Usability in the cold with gloves (clip assists and large zipper loops)
4. A very ergonomic back surface, with some breathability
5. Wide hip straps to distribute the load about the pelvis
6. Hip strap pockets for on-the-go access

The only point of failure that I can think of is that it does not have a laptop hammock, which is fair, because that's not what this backpack was intended for. Consequently, it also lacks a TSA compliant laptop compartment, but that's where a Nexus card comes in handy. Still, to solve the "this backpack does not have a laptop hammock, and I need to protect my laptop" problem, I'd recommend a [laptop sleeve][laptop sleeves].

## Timbuk2 Track II

[Timbuk2][timbuk2] makes some pretty awesome backpacks (especially commuter packs for cyclists). I bought the Track II back in 2011/2012 to force myself to carry less on my back, to reduce the stress on my back. Here's an accurate review of the backpack:

This backpack did everything it was designed for. Here are my only problems with this backpack (and why I had to look for another one):

1. No hip straps, so the weight was always on my shoulders
2. As much as I bought this for its reduced capacity (to reduce the load on my back), I still needed to carry more, so this backpack just wasn't designed for my needs.

## Honorable Mentions

[TenTree][ten tree] makes bags (and clothing, and other stuff, too) from recycled/reused plastics

# Emergency Repair Kit

Everyone should have a toolkit that enables them to solve most problems most of the time. The definition of "most" is certainly subjective, but here's my tooklit to solve 90% of problems 90% of the time. Some of these have to do with home improvement, while other have to do with electronics

## Allen Keys

## Screw Drivers

## Lock Pick Kit

## Tech First-aid USB keys

## Precision Screw Drivers

# Ski gear

## Feet

### Heated socks

## Hands

### Heated gloves

### Mittens

### Liners
