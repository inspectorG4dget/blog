# Introduction

This page lists my tech gear. Sometimes, there's a review attached. Other times, I haven't gotten around to writing a full review, or I don't have anything particularly relevant to say. If you do have any questions, please feel free to contact me, and I'll be happy to help out as best I can.

# Cellular Phone

While there is a lot to be said about how far phones have come, I find them to be very annoying - useful, but annoying.

Phones have a bad habit of having a very small keyboard for me to interface with. This is easily solved with an external keyboard, which I'd then have to carry around, making my "phone setup" less portable. It'd also imply that I'd have to setup my keyboard each time I want to use my phone, slowing down any operational readiness.

There are even laser keyboards that are more portable than their counterparts, but still need more setup. Plus, there's the whole battery charging issue.

Ultimately, cell phones are good for situational awareness (I need to know this thing now) and rapid response (I need to do this thing now). If anything can wait until I get to a full-sized keyboard, I'd rather do that.

So what do I use my phone for? Not games (I don't really have time for that). Mostly just phone calls, texts, scheduling, email triage, etc.
