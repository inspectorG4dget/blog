# Cellular Phone

While there is a lot to be said about how far phones have come, I find them to be very annoying - useful, but annoying.

Phones have a bad habit of having a very small keyboard for me to interface with. This is easily solved with an external keyboard, which I'd then have to carry around, making my "phone setup" less portable. It'd also imply that I'd have to setup my keyboard each time I want to use my phone, slowing down any operational readiness.

There are even laser keyboards that are more portable than their counterparts, but still need more setup. Plus, there's the whole battery charging issue.

Ultimately, cell phones are good for situational awareness (I need to know this thing now) and rapid response (I need to do this thing now). If anything can wait until I get to a full-sized keyboard, I'd rather do that.

So what do I use my phone for? Not games (I don't really have time for that). Mostly just phone calls, texts, scheduling, email triage, etc.

## Current Phone
I currently use a [Samsung Galaxy S8 (SMG 950W)][S8].

# Headphones and Headsets

I am no audiophile, but I do like good sound quality, and the ability to cocoon myself to "get in the zone" with good headphones. I used to use in-ear headphones for their sound isolating capabilities and the fact that they're super portable. However, they turn out to cause pimples in my ears when I use them for extended periods of time. 

Therefore, I made the switch (circa 2010) to over-the-ear headphones which are much more bulky but are the most comfortable. Here are the criteria that I usually look for when I buy headphones:

- Wired/wireless: I prefer wireless. In fact, I prefer Bluetooth so that the same headset may connect to my computer as well as my phone
- Audio quality: Look for a flat response curve (the flatter the better) and you should be good.
- Sound isolation: I prefer sound isolation to active noise canceling (because active noise cancellation requires a power source and therefore drains the battery), but I'm not opposed to the latter by any means.
- Audio leak: I prefer my headphones not leak audio. Therefore, they're usually closed back (which messes with the audio, yes, but not by enough for me to care). This is primarily so that my music does not interrupt the people I work beside.
- Breathability: sound isolation typically means that the ear cups are not very breathable. But some materials do allow for /some/ airflow, which keeps my ears from sweating. It's not my biggest concern in life, but it's something to keep an eye out for.

All that said, here are the headphones I've used:

## Sony XM4

Before I say anything, here's Marques Brownlee's review of these headphones.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bInJjmH31Hk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a really good headset. It's comfortable and light-weight and doesn't cause my ears to sweat too much.

The main reason I needed to buy this is that I needed a headset with a microphone that I could hear myself through. Because COVID forced me to work from home, I needed to increasingly be on more Zoom/Teams/Meet calls. These often required me to wear a headset so that my apartment didn't get too loud. The problem is that with sound isolating headsets, I tend to be unable to hear myself and have to speak louder to hear my own feedback - this makes my throat sore very quickly, which I don't like. 

While it is possible to configure OS-level software to send recorded feedback through the audio output, there is an unhelpful, noticeable delay. The solution seemed to be an audio interface, which tend to be expensive. For example, the [FocusRite Scarlett][focusrite scarlett] is a popular entry-level option, which costs > $200 at the time of this writing. Additionally, using audio interfaces makes it almost impossible to use wireless headphones, which was a deal-breaker for me.

## Avantree Aria

The [Avantree Aria][avantreeAria] is a good headset on paper. It even has a detachable boom mic, which swivels in place. An interesting feature is that the detachable boom mic attaches via a 3.5mm port, which means that when the battery dies, the headphones can survive with an auxiliary cable.

The downside to this headset is that the bluetooth compression isn't the best. This has two effects: 

1. There is a noticeable lag between the video and the audio
2. There are noticeable compression artifacts which hamper the audio quality in video calls (Zoom, Discord, Google Meet, etc.)

## Aftershokz Trekz Titanium

[These][aftershokz trekz titanium] were my experiment with Bone conduction technology, specifically for commuting. I've always wanted some headphones that delivered high-fidelity audio, but also allowed some ambient sound to play through. This is very counter-intuitive for "getting in the zone" at work. So it's important to understand that this is not what I'd recommend these headphones for.

I like these headphones as sport/commuter gear. They are lightweight and durable, and they leave the ears open, allowing me to hear ambient noise (so I can cross the street, knowing that I can still hear the traffic). They also fit well below (not under) my helmet when I'm on my bicycle.

Now to the downside:

1. I have sideburns which sometimes get irritated by the vibrations.
1. Using these for extended periods of time causes some sweat buildup on the skin where they rest. They also cause a "phantom vibration effect", somewhat like when I feel my phone buzzing in my pocket when it's not actually in there.

## Flashlights

I've always looked for a good flashlight, and I finally found [this one][rechargeableFlashlight]. It's sufficiently bright and is rechargeable via USB; it also has a beam focusing mechanism which is useful. But the two features that really seem me on this flashlight are:

1. it has a tactical magnet that lets you affix this to a wall or car body while working; and unlike most consumer magnets, this one's quite strong and attaches the flashlight robustly so that it falling is not an operational concern.
1. it has a few light modes, one of which is a wide beam from the side. This is super helpful especially when the magnetic surface is at an unhelpful mounting angle.

# Smart Watch

I find that a SmartWatch improves my productivity. Since my phone is always on vibrate, it is sometimes easy to miss notifications especially if I'm walking. A smartwatch solves this problem. Additionally, most pairing apps allow users to filter notifications and apps that are allowed to make the watch dispatch a notification. This affords a level of prioritization to allow only certain notifications to make it through to my phone.

It also makes it easier to find my phone when I misplace it, via the Find My Phone feature which can be launched directly from my watch.

Finally, it makes life easier especially in the winter, so that I don't have to remove my phone from some deep pocket to see the notification.

### Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2

Sadly, my Gear S2 died after four years of faithful service. I was very happy with that watch and wanted to buy it again, but it was still priced higher than newer models. So I decided to buy something similar but newer and cheaper. 

That's how I came across the [Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2][galaxyWatchAmazon]. It performs just as well as my previous Gear S2 and charges off the same dock. The one problem is that it does overheat on the Gear S2's charging dock, which causes it to stop charging until it cools down. It's not the biggest deal in the world and I continue to use it this way because the charger that came with the watch was not a dock (I can't find the correct image, but [here's something similar][active2cable]) and was therefore inconvenient to use.

A bonus feature I really like is that it lets me answer phone calls on my watch (over Bluetooth or Wifi - I don't have a data plan on my watch), so if my phone is away from me, I can still handle incoming phone calls on my watch with decent audio.

### Samsung Gear S2 Classic
[See it on Amazon][gearS2Amazon]

This is the first smartwatch I owned. It did a good job of sleep and fitness tracking while holding charge for up to 1.5 days. I'd recommend getting a [screen protector][gears2ScreenProtector] for it, though, as I did impact it against doors, bike handles, etc. But it kept up with me in the cold while skiing, while biking, at the gym, etc.

I did manage to lose the one charger that it came with, so I had to buy [this after-market charger][gears2Charger], which worked just fine.

# Laptop Stand

Back when I was a student, I had only my laptop and I used it for everything, even at my desk. This meant that my laptop was on my desk and was positioned badly for my posture. So I read a bunch of [ergonomics][laptopErgonomics] about how to best position my laptop and realized that I needed a stand to elevate the screen. But being as lazy as I am, I didn't want to replicate my setup at work at home, so I needed something light, portable, and durable. This is when I found out about [The Roost Stand][roost]. It was a kickstarter initiative by an engineer, and it was worth every penny. Unfortunately, the v1 product I purchased was compatible only with clamshell laptops (this is now discontinued - here's the [kickstarter origin story][roostKickstarter]), but I have since purchased [the v2 product][roostv2] as well, which is compatible with all laptop types. There is also [a v3 product][roostv3] currently available that I haven't used.

I purchased the v1 product circa 2012 and the v2 product circa 2020, and they both work just fine today. So I have first-hand experience to back up claims of their durability.

I am aware that [Nexstand makes a less expensive alternative][nexstand] and have friends that use it (without any complaints), but I haven't tested this myself and therefore can't say much about it.

# Keyboard

I have a thing for keyboards and am yet to find one that "does it" for me. I'm not a gamer and I fall in some odd minority in my choice of keyboards, keycaps, and switches. My requirements of a keyboard come from spending way too much of my daily time at my keyboard, which means that even small inefficiencies add up over a day.

Here's what I look for in a keyboard:

1. High operating force (so I can rest my fat fingers on it without accidentally effecting a keypress)
1. Low total travel distance
1. Not too loud so as not to distract others I work near
1. Some audio and tactile feedback because that's what I feel comfortable with
1. No numpad, so that my mouse isn't too far in the distance for me to use
1. Low profile so that I can rest my wrist on the desk and still use the keyboard with minimal dorsiflexion
1. wireless with a preference for bluetooth for multi-device connectivity
1. Chiclet style

## Logitech K750

By far, the best keyboard I've used so far is the [Logitech K750][logitech k750]. It is wireless (Logitech unifying receiver), has a very thin profile, and has a solar rechargeable battery (CR[-2032][cr2032]). It also has a decently high operating pressure, a very low total travel distance, and is not super loud. The only problem is that there's no version fo this keyboard without a numeric pad, which makes it just a tad annoying for me to use. Still, I own two of these keyboards and this is my first choice of keyboard to use.

You shouldn't ever need to change the battery, but if that need arises, it's not exactly the easiest thing to do, and there's all sorts of warnings advising you against doing this.

| Pros | Cons |
|:----:|:----:|
| Chiclet key layout | NumPad |
| Wireless | Not bluetooth - can't use this with phone |
| Low profile |  |
| High operating force |  |
| Quiet |  |
| Low total travel distance |  |
| Tactile feedback |  |
| Passively recharges battery | Battery recharging requires sufficient lighting |
| No battery e-waste | Difficult to replace battery | 

## Logitech K810

The [Logitech K810][logitech k810] is a Li-ion rechargeable bluetooth keyboard that remembers up to three devices. For a while, this was my favorite keyboard and I commuted to work with it in my backpack. It even charged via a computer's USB port, allowing it to function as a wired keyboard on that computer. It also had the ability to function while being charged, which was a massive bonus. It's apparently called the K811 now, but I don't see much of a functional difference between the two models.

| Pros | Cons |
|:----:|:----:|
| Chiclet key layout | |
| No numpad | |
| Wireless bluetooth with multipoint connectivity |  |
| Low profile |  |
| High operating force |  |
| Quiet |  |

| Tactile feedback |  |
| Easy to recharge battery |  |
| No battery e-waste |  |

## Logitech Ergo K860

I borrowed the [Logitech Ergo K860][logitech ergo k860] from a friend, to "try before I buy" - I will not buy this keyboard.

It's ergonomically great... if you want to write an essay. But I mostly write code, and the `\`, `ctrl`, `alt` keys are placed inconveniently and cramp my hand while trying to use this keyboard. Also, I'm not sure how well this will pan out for gaming. In any case, this is a good keyboard for anyone writing English all day, but not for my coding habit.

I Logitech ever reads this post, I would buy this keyboard if the `ctrl`, `alt`, and `start` keys were positioned closer to the middle of the keyboard - either eating into the spacebar's realestate, or positioned just under it. Either of those design updated would solve my finger cramping issue and make this keyboard usable, even with the numeric pad.

| Pros | Cons |
|:----:|:----:|
| Chiclet key layout | NumPad |
| Wireless bluetooth with multipoint connectivity |  |
| Ergnomically built, with wrist rest |  |
| High operating force |  |
| Quiet | A little too quiet |
|  | Higher total travel distance |
| Tactile feedback |  |
| Easy to replace 2xAAA battery | Battery e-waste |
